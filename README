Ensure your UCFK4 is connected to the USB port.
Type make to compile the program, and then type make program to upload the game onto the Funkit.

Usage

Initially the game loads up by displaying the "Whack-A-Mole !!" message.
To start the game, push the navswitch down. This will start a thirty second timer in the background which is the total time you have to play the game.
The game starts immediately after. You will now notice a blinking LED at the middle of the display. This is the cursor which you can move around with the navswitch. The cursor is able to loop back around the edges of the display.
At this point random LEDs will start lighting up. These are the 'moles'. To 'whack' the mole. Move your cursor over the LED and push down on the general-purpose push button. To confirm you have 'whacked' the 'mole', the blue LED will flash once.
The game keeps track of how many 'moles' have been 'whacked'. After the thirty second timer is over, this score will be displayed to you.
When the score is being displayed, pressing down on the navswitch will reset the game and take you back to the opening display. Pressing the navswitch down again will start the game again.
